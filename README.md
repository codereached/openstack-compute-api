# A Proposed Next Version of the OpenStack Compute API

This repository contains a single document (this one) describing a proposed new
OpenStack Compute API. I've used [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org/)
for formatting and describing the proposed API.

# Project [/projects/{id}]

A project is a grouping of related server resources.

# Server Type [/server\_types/{id}]

A server type describes the capacity and capabilities of a class of servers.

# Server Template [/server\_templates/{id}]

A server template is a base disk image, a bootable volume, or a snapshot of
a server instance that is used as the basis of a server when it is launched.

# Server [/servers/{id}]

A server is a virtual machine that runs in an OpenStack cloud. It is owned by
a single *project*, has a single *server type* that describes its capabilities
and capacity, and is launched from a *server template* that is a base disk
image, a bootable volume, or a snapshot of another server.

## Retrieve Server [GET]

Retrieve a server by its *id*.
